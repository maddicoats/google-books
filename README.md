# Google Books API Search Engine

## MVP

Create a page that allows users to search for books

Page should include:
-   Header section introducing the page
-   Form containing a text input and a submit / search button
-   A grid of books

    Instructions:

-   When the submit button is clicked you need to request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
-   The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
-   Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
-   The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
-   You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then
